/*
You are given an array target of n integers. From a starting array arr consisting of n 1's, you may perform the following procedure :

let x be the sum of all elements currently in your array.
choose index i, such that 0 <= i < n and set the value of arr at index i to x.
You may repeat this procedure as many times as needed.
Return true if it is possible to construct the target array from arr, otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: target = [9,3,5]
Output: true
Explanation: Start with arr = [1, 1, 1] 
[1, 1, 1], sum = 3 choose index 1
[1, 3, 1], sum = 5 choose index 2
[1, 3, 5], sum = 9 choose index 0
[9, 3, 5] Done
Example 2:

Input: target = [1,1,1,2]
Output: false
Explanation: Impossible to create target array from [1,1,1,1].
Example 3:

Input: target = [8,5]
Output: true
 

Constraints:

n == target.length
1 <= n <= 5 * 104
1 <= target[i] <= 109

            //when there are elements greeter than 1 then sum of other elements can not be 0 or sum can not be greater than top element because sum + x(any number>0) is pq.top().

            pq.pop();     //Deleting greatest element
